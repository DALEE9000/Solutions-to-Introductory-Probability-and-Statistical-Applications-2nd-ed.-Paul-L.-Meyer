If referenced, please cite me (David A. Lee). All errata and other offenses are my own. You may reach out to me (@DavidALee0) on Twitter to suggest corrections, should they be needed.

PDFs of solutions are final drafts unless denoted as a "Work-in-Progress." Unfinished problems, if any, are listed at the outset of each solution set. All solutions are typeset in LaTeX using TeXShop.
